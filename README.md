# GRFreire's scripts

## About
In this repo you will find some scripts that I wrote (or found) while using and tinkering with linux. This is a WIP.

Most of them should work just fine in your pc with you meet the requirements (specified in each script page). Some may work in macOS as well - although I never tested.

## How to install

1. Clone this repo:
``git clone https://github.com/GRFreire/scripts $HOME/.scripts``

2. Add to your path:
