# vid2mov

## About
a simple script around ffmpeg to convert a video file to `.mov`.

I personally use this script when I record something in OBS Studio and then want to import into DaVinci Resolve.

## Requirements
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
- [notify-send](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libnotify) (optional)
